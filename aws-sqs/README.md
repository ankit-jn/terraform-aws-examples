## ARJ-Stack: Terraform AWS - Simple Queue Service (SQS) Examples

Set of Example Configurations to provision fast, scalable, and serverless time-series database and tables.

#### Amazon SQS Example: Standard Queue with SSE-SQS Encryption Example

This Example configuration is used to provision SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-SQS.

Refer [Configuration Example](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-examples/tree/main/aws-sqs/standard-sse-sqs) for the code-base to utilize [Module: Terraform AWS - Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-sqs) in order to create SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-SQS.

#### Amazon SQS Example: Standard Queue with SSE-KMS (AWS Owned) Encryption Example

This Example configuration is used to provision SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-KMS (AWS owned).

Refer [Configuration Example](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-examples/tree/main/aws-sqs/standard-sse-kms) for the code-base to utilize [Module: Terraform AWS - Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-sqs) in order to create SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-KMS (AWS owned).

#### Amazon SQS Example: Standard Queue with SSE-KMS (Custome Managed Master Key) Encryption Example

This Example configuration is used to provision SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-KMS (Customer Managed Master Key).

Refer [Configuration Example](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-examples/tree/main/aws-sqs/standard-sse-kms-cmk) for the code-base to utilize [Module: Terraform AWS - Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-sqs) in order to create SQS Queue (Standard) with message encryption through SSE-KMS (Customer Managed Master Key).

#### Amazon SQS Example: FIFO Queue with SSE-SQS Encryption Example

This Example configuration is used to provision SQS Queue (FIFO) with message encryption through SSE-SQS.

Refer [Configuration Example](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-examples/tree/main/aws-sqs/fifo-sse-sqs) for the code-base to utilize [Module: Terraform AWS - Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://github.com/arjstack/terraform-aws-sqs) in order to create SQS Queue (FIFO) with message encryption through SSE-SQS.
